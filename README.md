# Quantium-Internship
This repository contains my solution to the [Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program on Forage](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/NkaC7knWtjSbi6aYv/Data-Analytics?ref=DsEXFixxovqkRxR2u).

#**Task 1: Data preparation and customer analytics**

Analyze transaction and customer data to identify trends and inconsistencies. 

Develop metrics and examine sales drivers to gain insights into overall sales performance. 

Create visualizations and prepare findings to formulate a clear recommendation for the client's strategy

#**Task 2: Experimentation and uplift testing**
Extend your analysis from Task 1 to help you identify benchmark stores that allow you to test the impact of the trial store layouts on customer sales.                                  Select control stores – explore the data and define metrics for your control store selection – think about what would make them a control store. Look at the drivers and make sure you visualize these in a graph to better determine if they are suited. For this piece, it may even be worth creating a function to help you.

Assessment of the trial – this one should give you some interesting insights into each of the stores, check each trial store individually in comparison with the control store to get a clear view of its overall performance. We want to know if the trial stores were successful or not.

Collate findings – summarise your findings for each store and provide a recommendation that we can share with Julia outlining the impact on sales during the trial period.
